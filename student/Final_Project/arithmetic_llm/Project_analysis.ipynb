    "To study out-of-distribution generalization, we evaluated the instruction-tuned arithmetic model on expressions with progressively larger operand ranges. The model was trained on operands sampled from 1–20. When evaluated within this range, it achieved an exact-match accuracy of 43.9%. When the range was expanded to 1–99, accuracy dropped to 18.8%, and further decreased to 1.8% for operands sampled from 1–999. In contrast, the parse success rate remained relatively stable (≈85–90%), indicating that the model continued to follow the expected output format. These results suggest that while instruction-following behavior generalizes well, the underlying arithmetic reasoning learned by the model does not scale to larger numeric ranges."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the model’s ability to generalize beyond its training distribution, we tested it on arithmetic expressions with increasing operand ranges: 1–20, 1–99, and 1–999. The results show a clear degradation in performance as the numbers become larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluated on expressions within the training-like range (1–20), the model achieves approximately 50% accuracy, indicating that it has learned to solve a substantial portion of the arithmetic problems seen during training. However, when the operand range increases to 1–99, accuracy drops to roughly 30%, and for 1–999, correct predictions almost disappear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error analysis further reveals that most failures are wrong answers rather than formatting errors. Even when the model produces incorrect results, it typically generates outputs that follow the expected reasoning structure with <think> blocks and a final answer. This indicates that the model has learned the output format and reasoning style, but not the underlying arithmetic rules required for accurate computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, formatting errors such as unclosed <think> tags appear more frequently for larger operand ranges. This suggests that as arithmetic expressions become more complex, the model’s reasoning chain becomes less stable and more prone to incomplete generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these results suggest that the model **primarily learns patterns within the training distribution rather than general arithmetic reasoning**. While it can replicate the structure of step-by-step solutions, its ability to correctly compute results deteriorates rapidly when faced with numbers outside the range seen during training."

    "## Interpretation: Accuracy vs Expression Depth\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot shows how model accuracy changes as the expression depth increases while keeping the operand range fixed at 1–20.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results indicate that increasing the expression depth leads to only a small decrease in accuracy. When evaluated on expressions with depth 4, the model achieves an accuracy of approximately 43.9%. Increasing the depth to 6 reduces accuracy slightly to 43.0%, and further increasing the depth to 8 results in an accuracy of about 41.6%.\n",
    "\n",
    "This relatively small drop suggests that the model is capable of handling moderately longer reasoning chains when the arithmetic operands remain within the training range. In other words, the model does not struggle significantly with deeper expression structures as long as the numerical values remain simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result contrasts with the earlier experiment on larger operand ranges, where accuracy dropped dramatically. Therefore, the findings suggest that the primary limitation of the model lies in generalizing to larger numbers rather than handling deeper reasoning structures."
